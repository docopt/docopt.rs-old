# rust-docopt

This is a port of Python docopt library http://github.com/docopt/docopt

** WORK IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS **


Requirements:
-------------

- Rust >= 0.4
- GNU Make >= 3.81


Building & tests
----------------
Run following commands to init and update git submodules::

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

To build and run language agnostic tests::

    make

By default only first test is used, as by now nothing is
implemented yet, i.e. all tests are red.
